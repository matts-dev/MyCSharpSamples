CLR										//https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/f64127/What-is-cli-clr/
	CLR - common language runtime.
	CLR is an executing engine.
	CLR is responsible for executing an executable
	CLR is responsible for managing lifetime of an executable
	CLR also known as "the runtime".
	CLR and java's JVM are both prcoess virtual machines. comparisons: https://www.overops.com/blog/clr-vs-jvm-how-the-battle-between-net-and-java-extends-to-the-vm-level/
	CLR manages code written in .net languages
		C#, VB.NET, F#
		code targeting CLR is "managed code"
		code must folow common standard
			code must emit and attach metadata with eveyr binary or PE(portable executable)
			meta data inlcudes
				types, objects, members, references
				meta data used load types/allocate memory/managememory lifetime/resolve method invocations/ generative native code/ enforce security/ set runtimecontext boundaries
	CLR functions
		automatic memory mangement with garbage collection
			relase unused objects, managing pool of threads, reserve locations
		cross language interoperability
		structured exception handling
		code access security
		thread excecution, thread pooling, and context
		debugging
		verification and compliance 
	CTS = common type system, based on CLI
		CLR uses CTS based on CLI
	CLR implements the VES defined in the CLI standard

CLI
	CLI = Common Language infrastructure
	CLI is a ***specification*** (by microsoft)
		-describes executable code
		-describes runtime environment
		-allows high level programming languages on various machines using same code
	CLI 4 components
		CTS (common type system)
			-defines basic data types
			-every language designed to be used with .net should be able to "match"/use these datatypes 
				-this makes various languages able to communicate with each other; ie cross language interoperability
		CLS (common language specification)
			-set of specifications that must be met by a language to be .net compliant 
			-subset of CTS types 
			-set of rules
				-eg elimiation of pointers and elimination of multiple inheritance
		Metadata
			-gives information about classes, class members, defined in the assembly
		VES (Virtual Execution System)
			VES loads and runs programs using metadata
	CLI set of specifications for a virtual operating system(the CLR)
